<h1>THE HISTORY OF OUR COMPANY</h1>
<p><font size="4" color=black>In 2000 we began production of an innovative, patented pedal tricycle. The current version is the R32 model. We have the only foldable tricycle available on the market. It can be folded in 5 seconds with three very simple steps. It is also very simple and quick to return it to being a comfortable tricycle that is very useful for people that have difficulty using a bicycle, for the elderly who wish to stay fit, for people with mild physical handicaps or for people who simply want a different means for pedalling. </font></p>
